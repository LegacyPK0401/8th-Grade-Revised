    <h1>Intro</h1>

    <p> My name is Porosh Khan. I was born on April's Fools Day 2005. Yes, I am a living punchline. One of my passionate interests is the very idea of technology. I like that technology can be this thing that can help humanity as a whole. Things like the Apple Watch is a good example. As of the current revision, the Apple Watch Series 6 is the latest model. When people think of a smart watch, people usually think a watered down version of a phone on your wrist. It can primarily forward your notifications to your wrist and is slightly focused on health. But the Apple Watch changed that. From the stereotypical answer, it became a heavily focused health tracking watch with an ECG to detect irregular hear rates. Not only that it has an accelerometer for fall detection. Say you have fallen and cannot reach your phone, your watch will be able to detect that fall and automatically call emergency services after 5 seconds of inactivity after a fall. That in it of itself is a very useful feature for everyone, not just for the elderly. And the Apple Watch and tech in general just gets better and better every year. That's why I admire technology; evolution and the abilty to help people with their needs.</p>

    <h2>Tech</h2>

      <p>If you know me (or have read the passage above), I admire technology a lot. The science of technology is something people thought of years ago. Those visionaries thought it would never happen. But thanks to science (unknown magic) our smartphones, laptops, PCs, and other forms of technology. HTML (this) and javascript are the standards that most things are formatted to and is the fundamental base of everything technology.</p>

    <h2>Marvel and DC Mythos</h2>

     <p>Another interest I have is superhero movies and stories. I find superheroes facinating because the variety of stories and impact they can leave on the reader. I also like the idea of superheroes because it can give people hope and shows that no one is alone. It also inspires others to write stories of their own or to make intersting theories about a certain hero, or about a storyline, or about an entire universe. </p>

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
     <p>This is something that be boring to most people but to me, it's interesting. Basically my philosophy is that everything has consequences. Based on your actions, dialogue, etc, it foreshadows your endgoal. You could either end up successful, a failure, or a carcass. It might just common sense or just something I made up I don't know for sure. A visual representation of this is a waterfall. It starts off with a lake, then gravity splits the water(water molecules) up in different ways in many shapes and sizes, finally it ends up in an another big lake. Pretend your life when you were born was the first big lake, then your life starts like the water falling. There are millions of possibilites that could happen but it's up to you in which path you go down through.Which are like the millions of water drops. Once your life ends, you would've lived your life/fate.</p>
